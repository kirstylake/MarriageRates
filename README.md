The concept of marriage originated many years before recorded history, but the earliest record of this tradition
dates back to about 2350 BC in the Far East [8].
This tradition was then accepted into many different cultures accross the world as time progressed. The
concept of marriage has evolved from it's origins (which was one man being married to multiple women) to
include mainly monagomy as the guiding principle for Western marriages and then later, same-sex marriage.
It is known from history, that the main purpose for marriage originally was to be an alliance between families
(with a political or economical goal in mind). Marriages were mainly arranged , and in some cultures they still
are arranged.
Although marriages can by polygamous, same-sex, monagamous, arranged or out of love, it is still widely
recognized that one of the main caveats of marriage is a bond between two people that involves responsibility,
commitment, legalities and challenge.
Marriages have evolved as a concept to be more inclusive, however as time goes on it can be seen that less
and less young people are deciding to get married. I aim to show this data cohesively in this project.
Furthermore, I aim to identify trends between economics, social, political and other factors that correlate to the
downward spiral in this tradition.

***Aims and Objectives***
I would like to explore the following:
Are marriage rates decreasing throughout the world over time?
Measuring marriage trends accross different countries over time
Finding a measure to explore the spread of data
If so, why?
What educational correlations are there?
What economic correlations are there?
Are there any other important factors to take into consideration?
For this project, my aims are as follows:
1. Decide how much data is needed to sufficiently investigate marriage trends over time
2. Decide which data to use for analysis
3. Collect data using by accessing CSV files from government websites
4. Clean and store the data
5. Carry out exploratory analysis on the data and display any trends that are found in a graphical format
6. Find correlations and infer causation from the data sets
